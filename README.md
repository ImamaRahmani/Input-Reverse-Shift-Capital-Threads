# Input-Reverse-Shift-Capital-Threads
I created four threads other than main thread.  1. Input thread  2. Reverse thread  3. Capital thread  4. Shift thread.  Input thread takes string input from user, reverse thread reverses the string and output it,  capital thread capitalizes the characters of string and output it and shift thread shifts each characters of the string two time (e.g. a will become c) and output it. All the threads wait for input thread when input thread finishes his task all the waiting thread start their work simultaneously. I handled the exceptions of input thread. Also took care the state of each thread.
